# OpenCV-project-Aruco-Marker-
You work in a firm where they have a specific department, to autonomously put aruco markers on square boxes. Your task is to write a python code, for finding square boxes in an image and then place aruco markers exactly overlapping on it with the following rules.



Box Colour
Marker ID
Green
1
Orange
2
Black
3
Pink-Peach
4


The aruco markers should exactly be placed on the squares only, even the orientation of the square should be kept in mind.

As for your convenience, you will be given these markers in the same folder, but not with their id specified
Hope you don't change the orientation of the boxes while placing the markers :)
